COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy. Happy to be right here with you on this wonderful Wednesday. We're halfway through the week, so let's lock in and keep aiming to be a little better today than we were yesterday. Now, in previous episodes, we've discussed the ongoing war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February of this year. This week, Russia launched a new round of missiles against Ukraine. The more than 50 missiles largely targeted critical facilities in Kyiv, the capital city in Ukraine. This is part of Russia's increasing attacks against critical infrastructure across the country.  This week, 80 percent of residents in Kyiv were left without water and as of Monday, many homes and businesses were without electricity as well. One of the missile strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350 apartments in the capital, impacting many people who lost power. The Ukrainian government urged residents to stock up on water from shops and pumping stations after the attack. Following the attacks, emergency services in Ukraine were attempting to restore power and stabilize the situation as soon as possible, especially before the start of winter. Leaders in Kyiv were also calling on assistance from the European Union and NATO as well as several governments. By yesterday, Ukraine had already made agreements with 12 countries to obtain nearly 1,000 units of power equipment, including generators. And this isn't the first time Ukrainian citizens haven't had access to water. Survivors of the siege in the city of Mariupol at the start of the war had to collect rain water and melted snow for drinking Russian. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the recent onslaught of missiles are a response to an attack on Russia's fleet in Crimea on Saturday, which he blamed on Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  Life just got harder in Kyiv. Monday morning, 80 percent of the capital's water off following a new barrage of Russian airstrikes, spigots not use since the war began a lifeline again, but not unexpected.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everyone in Kyiv right now and they choose to stay here. They are like ready for this.  ROBERTSON:  Will it make you leave the city?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I will stay here. I didn't leave it since the war begins. So, why have to do it now?  ROBERTSON:  Despite the long lines in some parts of the city, patience aplenty.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm standing with my friends in one hour, maybe two- hour, maybe three, maybe no water after 20 minutes. But I'll go back.  ROBERTSON:  Scenes like this are becoming increasingly normal across Ukraine. Government officials say that there were ten different regions targeted Monday, 18 different sites.  Among them, a hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine's biggest in Zaporizhzhia. Another power gen site in central Ukraine. Kharkiv subway in the east still by strikes on vital infrastructure there.  And despite intercepts, 44 across the country, according to the government, groups of missiles getting through, at least three according to this witness near Kyiv's hydroelectric power plant.  A missile flew over our house and went to the balcony, and saw the second missile and a drone, she says, both were flying in the direction of the power plant. It's so scary when you see it.  Three weeks of targeting Ukraine's electricity network is pushing the power grid towards a tipping point, no doubt more of this to come.  Nic Robertson, Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is considered the most expensive object ever built? The Burj Khalifa, the Oakland Bay Bridge, the International Space Station, or the London Crossrail? With estimates over $100 billion, the football field size International Space Station is by far the most expensive project ever constructed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  French astronaut Thomas Pesquet spent six months aboard the International Space Station last year. He says that experience made him realize we live in an oasis in the cosmos that we need to protect. He also says they've discovered technology that could lead to us eating the packaging that our food comes in. For today's "Call to Earth" segment, we're heading 248 miles high to get a view of the earth very few people get to see. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) THOMAS PESQUET, ASTRONAUT AND FAO GOODWILL AMBASSADOR:  When you look at the Earth from the space station, it's absolutely magical. It glows in blue, and it's the most beautiful scenery you could possibly imagine.  When you take a step back and you see the arsenic's entirety, you understand it it's just an oasis in the cosmos. All around, there's nothing. No life. It's blackness emptiness and there's this blue bowl with everything we need to sustain human life and life in general which is absolutely fragile. It makes you want to cherish the Earth. I'm Thomas Pesquet, an astronaut for the European Space Agency. I'm coming back from my second mission to space, all onboard the International Space Station, so permanent laboratory that orbits the Earth.  Just like us on board of space station, the Earth is a spaceship and we are its crew. It flies around the sun. It has limited resources. It has some protection means but they can be overcome. You don't control the amount of resources that you have on board but you have to manage them. And what you can control, the way you care about the spaceship, the way you maintain it because you want the flight to be as long and peaceful as possible.  You can see a lot of the consequences of human activities from space. Some of them climate change, some of them are just plain old pollution.  My first mission was in 2016 launch, 2017 landing. My second mission was five years later, 2021, and I could see a difference. The most visible effect is glaciers retreating, year after year mission after mission. You know, the ice caps melting in the poles. I'm an ambassador for the food and agricultural organization of the United Nations. But during my mission on the space station, we had a lot of research done on plants because space is a harsh environment for plants. By studying plants in the environment of space, then we can study how they can resist to a drought or water scarcity, and then we can feed all those results to research being made on Earth and to create some more resistant crops, the crops that will resist to climate change.  We've also worked a lot on all our packaging just like on Earth, we're trying to limit the production the use of plastic the production of waste and so we came up with edible packaging, which is just a such a fantastic and simple concept. We need foam to protect everything from shocks during launch into space, so what we did is we turned that foam into food it's like gingerbread. Now, our packaging is at the same time our source of food. It reduces the need to send cargo up. It reduces the production of trash. It's brilliant. So, hopefully, that technology can also transfer to packaging on the ground and then we can reduce our environmental footprint every time we go buy something in the supermarket.  If we set ourselves on the right path, there's nothing we cannot do. We built that unbelievable facility in space. We're using it every day, peaceful cooperation between countries that we're not always friends. So if we can transfer that model to the way we deal with the environment I think we'll get there. I'm optimistic for the future. If we can make a space station fly, then we can save the planet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we have a story creating a big buzz. It turns out bumblebees may be more complex than we thought. U.K. scientists designed an experiment that gave 45 bumblebees the choice between a clear path to food or a player filled with wooden balls.  Well, honey, the result was something to beehold. The bees repeatedly chose to roll the balls around, sometimes over 100 times. Researchers believe that this show's bees found playtime rewarding. Now, that's intere-sting. Shout out time now. Hive-five to Greeley, Nebraska, Central Valley Public Schools, rise up.  And I'll leave you with this today: if there's something you want out there, think about the goal, speak about the goal, believe you'll reach it and you just might achieve it.  We'll see you tomorrow. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221031

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you! Hope you had a happy hollow weekend and you're ready to trick go treat yourself later today. Can't wait to see your costumes. I've already been loving some of the bald dude costumes I've seen like the one from math teacher Allison Frank (ph) from Philly and some of you have some serious vest game, we could be vesties.  I'm Coy. This is CNN. Let's start this week off strong.  The midterms are one week away. On November 8th, Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices. They're called midterm elections remember because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives is up for election, while about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs.  Many states have aligned their elections on this schedule which means governors as well as various state officials, local positions and government initiatives are on the ballot. The main question on everyone's mind is, will Democrats maintain control of the Congress for the remainder of this presidential term? Or will Republicans take control of one or both chambers of Congress?  Then, what about those races for governor and state legislatures? We'll hear now from CNN national politics reporter Eva McKend on how the results of this year's election could impact the next two years of politics in America, (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  President Joe Biden needs Democrats to win in the 2022 midterms, if he wants to move his policy agenda forward. Yet the president's party almost always loses seats in midterm elections. The party in the White House has lost seats in Congress in every midterm except for four in the last 150 years.  And poll suggests that voters are disappointed in what President Biden and the Democratic majority have accomplished so far, which doesn't bode well for their 2022 chances. SEN. MITCH MCCONELL (R-KY):  And it's my hope that the '22 election will be a referendum on the performance of the current administration.  MCKEND:  So what would Republican power in Congress mean? First, Biden's political agenda will be fully halted. He's already had a hard time getting much of his policy priorities passed. Democrats have a narrow majority in both the Senate and House if they lose even a few seats in 2022, Republicans will take back power and stop Biden in his tracks. Of course, Republicans would then find it difficult to get anything passed and signed by President Biden. This all leads to gridlock on Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these social media sites has the lowest character limit per post? Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or TikTok? The current limit for a tweet is 280 characters, far lower than the others. But changes may soon be coming for the Twitterverse. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Today is the day many people thought they would never see Elon Musk taking control of Twitter. Of course, the question now is what is he going to do with the company, with the platform?  He's expressed his frustration with how many fake accounts and bots are on the platform, so we could see him doing something with that. But he's also expressed discomfort about permanently banning people from the platform, knows most notably of course that former U.S. President Donald Trump who was kicked off at the platform for good we thought after the January attack on the Capitol.  Musk saying though that he will not be making these decisions anytime soon. He is going to set up a council he says of experts who are going to advise on these types of decisions around speech, around what they should do about banning people or bringing them back.  Within the company itself, speaking to people who work there today, a lot of worry, a lot of concern about what is going to happen with the company, but also what is going to happen with their jobs and their livelihoods. Donie O'Sullivan, CNN, Dallas. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're headed to outer space. NASA's InSight lander, a robotic spacecraft designed to land on the surface of Mars, has completed its mission to map the planet and its interior. The latest mission found information that changes how experts view the formation of planets and their relationship to Earth. CNN space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher is on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER:  Touchdown confirmed! (CHEERS) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Three years after NASA's InSight lander touched down on Mars, it has delivered the information that it was sent to collect from millions of miles away.  BRUCE BANERDT, PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, MARS INSIGHT:  This is definitely a data that we've been waiting decades for. FISHER:  For the first time, scientists have mapped the interior of another rocky planet. They discovered a thinner than expected crust. And the biggest surprise a larger lighter and more liquid core than earlier estimates.  For comparison, Earth's core is much more dense. Meaning the Martian core is at least partially made of different elements. Why is this important? Why should Earthlings care about the composition of Mars? BANERDT:  It allows us to take our theories of the formation of rocky planets in general and the Earth in particular and understand how our planet formed out of the initial solar nebula, how it changed from just kind of a ball of kind of gray, indistinguishable meteoritic material to the diverse planet we have today with oceans and continents. FISHER:  On Earth, there are earthquakes. But on Mars, they are called Mars-quakes. The InSight lander is cutting edge seismometer spent two years measuring them and tracking those seismic waves as they rippled through the Red Planet, while NASA's other active robot is focused on the surface. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Halloween is upon us, and according to the National Retail Federation, Americans are ghouling all out, spending a record amount of mummy on Halloween this year -- whether it's buying candy, costumes, decorations or pumpkins to carve.  Let's break down the economics of this year's Halloween. Spending is projected to hit a record $10.6 billion in 2022, and participation in Halloween related activities will resume to pre-pandemic levels, with nearly 70 percent of consumers planning to celebrate. That's up from 65 percent last year and even, the 68 percent who celebrated pre-  pandemic in 2019. But no matter how you spend your Halloween, one thing we can all agree upon is that not all Halloween candy is created equal, according to Candy Commerce. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can't process that this is even candy. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've never seen these before either. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You also might heave. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's actually disgusting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That is not great.  CARLY SCHILDHAUS, SPOKESPERSON, NATIONAL CONFECTIONERS ASSOCIATION:  What you may love might not be somebody else's favorite. But there's something for everybody to enjoy.  SUBTITLE:  According a National Retail Fed. Survey, Halloween participation is expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels.  SCHILDHAUS:  Each year, we do over four billion dollars in sales and this year, we are projecting about a five percent increase in chocolate and candy sales. For Halloween this year, the top three treats are chocolate, candy corn, which I know is controversial, and gummy candy. SUBTITLE:  Not all candies are loved equally.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't know why people hate on me so much. They're really not that bad.  SCHILDHAUS:  Whether you love it or you, let's say, don't love it, candy corn is an iconic part of the Halloween season. MARCIA MOGELONSKY, DIRECTOR OF INSIGHT, FOOD & DRINK, MINTEL:  It is a direct link to the past because it is a nostalgia, reminder of, you know, everybody always got candy corn and we always hated it but we always ate it. Everybody can talk about candy corn. It doesn't matter where you are, you can start a conversation. Candy corn has become one of those commonalities. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It might just be a good memory and not a good reality. SCHILDHAUS:  And people feel that really strong nostalgic tie to different treats. So there are plenty of treats out there that again are really innovative and exciting, but people also have that strong emotional connection to maybe something they enjoyed as a child, or at a -- at a particularly exciting or challenging time in their life. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Circus peanuts seemed like a mistake. I'm surprised they're still around. MOGELONSKY:  You give what you remember from the past. You give what you can afford. To buy whatever looks familiar to them. Oh, yeah, I remember those Smarties, I'll take those. There are people who cannot afford to give out Haribo and full-sized Hershey bars to their community. It just doesn't work that way, but they want to have something to give and this is what they can afford. We'll always have candy. There is something about candy and Americans that is just inseparable. You just have to have our security blanket of sweets. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10. An Iowa dad going all out to freak out unsuspecting trick-or-treaters. Greg Dietzenbach created the Monstdoor. The seemingly normal door with a wreath comes to life with digitized eyes and furry arms claws and gnarly teeth. The fuzzy purple people eater was created by using a high def TV for the eyes, cutting out door panels and using broomsticks for the arms, and a foam wreath with puppet-like strings for the mouth and teeth.  And the result, a perfect 10 out of 10 on the frickle-meter (ph). All right. My sweet like candy, voodoo-ful people, I'm witching you a fantastic Halloween.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of this day with you right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with an update on the midterm elections in the United States. In two weeks, Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices. As we've said, these elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. Currently members from President Joe Biden's political party, the Democratic Party, controlled both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate but Democrats control both chambers by a thin margin. In fact, in the Senate, it's currently a tie with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker vote. Let's take 10 to break it all down in the House, there are 435 voting members elected every two years so every seat is up for re-election this year. However senators are elected every six years, so about a third of those seats are up for re-election. Historically, lawmakers who are in the same party as the president tend to lose seats in the midterm elections regardless of who the president is. Americans head to the polls to cast their vote on November 8th.  If Republicans take the majority in one or both chambers, this would likely make for a more difficult road for President Biden's Democratic agenda, the remainder of his term. There's a lot of attention on this election and you've likely seen the political advertisements, especially if you live in a state with a tight race.  Early voter turnout for the 2022 midterms appears to be on pace to shatter the previous records set in 2018. Let's hear more now from CNN anchor and chief national correspondent John King who's looking at three key Senate races that could determine which party gains control in the New Year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The numbers tell the story better than any words can. The Democrats have a majority but just barely, the vice president breaks the tie in the 50-50 Senate. The question is, can the Democrats keep that majority in a very difficult midterm election year climate, 35 Senate elections in all.  Let's look at three likely to determine which party controls this chamber come January. Let's start in Pennsylvania. No incumbent here, Pat Toomey, the Republican is retiring. Democrat John Fetterman versus Dr. Oz, you know him from TV, he's the Republican candidate backed by Donald Trump. So let's go back in time, the 2020 presidential race, what will we look for on election night.  We will start over here in the Pennsylvania suburbs. The Democrats need to run it up here. Fetterman now the lieutenant governor was mayor of Braddock, it's out here near Pittsburgh. Can he do what Joe Biden did in say Montgomery County?  These are the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Look at Joe Biden's margins. That's why he's president of the United States. The suburbs win against Trump in 2018, even more so in 2020. Can Fetterman match Biden in the Philadelphia suburbs? That is one key test.  The other question, the flip side of that is, can Mehmet Oz run like George W. Bush or George H.W. Bush did in these suburbs? They used to be Republican suburbs or at least open to Republicans. Can Dr. Oz do that?  Let's go down to another marquee race, Georgia. Marquee because you have a Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock. Marquee because you have a football hero, Republican Herschel Walker.  Interesting because you also have a libertarian candidate here and on Georgia on election night, if you don't get 30 percent plus one, then we have a runoff in December. So that's one big thing to look for in Georgia.  What else do we look for? Just like in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden won Georgia because he won in the suburbs. Here's Atlanta Democratic base, obviously, Senator Warnock needs that. But how does he do in places like Rockdale County, moving away from Atlanta?  Traditionally, Republican or purple suburbs, they have become more Democratic especially in the Trump age. Can Senator Warnock get anything like that or can Herschel Walker prove that he can contest for the suburbs? And just like Dr. Oz, as a newcomer to politics, Herschel Walker has to prove if he is to win -- see all that red? That is Donald Trump's strength in rural America. Can Herschel Walker in a place like Dodge County -- not a lot of votes, it's small but they add up if you win all these small counties by margins like that. Let's come back to the Senate map and let's move out west to the state the Democrats are most worried about and it's a surprise.  Nevada, you have a Democratic incumbent here, she is a Latina. This is a state where the Latino vote is critical. So why is Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in some trouble? Number one, Laxalt is a big brand name in Nevada politics. So you have a very close race between the Democratic incumbent and a very well-known Republican. To win Nevada, you have to win Clark County and you have to win big. Clark County is the home to Vegas. If you can see that up there, it's nearly 75 percent. It's around percent of the statewide population if you can run it up here, you can win.  It was reasonably close last time, right? Joe Biden just won Nevada that was a surprise to many Democrats. They thought he'd have a bigger margin. Why? Donald Trump made inroads among Latino voters, especially male Latino voters.  So one of the tests is we watch the Senate race this time is can the incumbent, a Latina, dominate the Latino vote? That is critical. Or the Republicans keep making inroads. That could make that one incredibly close as we move from east to Midwest to West and count the votes come election night.

Originally known as sidewalk surfing, the first commercial skateboards began appearing in 1959. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. I think you all know me and my team well enough now to know that we love sharing stories that inspire and make us all reconsider what we think is possible.  I introduce you now to Dan Mancina, a skateboarder who lost his eyesight at 23 years old due to a neurodegenerative disease. But his perseverance is a reminder that when circumstances build up walls around us, we have to find ways to continue to build ourselves up within them because changing within leads to changes without. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN MANCINA, SKATEBOARDER:  Add some O&M training which is orientation and mobility, that's using the white cane, that really helped shift my mindset and get some of my mobility and freedom back and self-confidence. SUBTITLE:  After quitting skating for a few years, Mancina found his way back to the sport.  He started filming short videos of his progress and posting them onto Instagram and YouTube. He then met a new group of people to skate with, eventually gaining enough confidence to return to the streets. MANCINA:  It was just kind of a slow, you know, dealing with, coping with, you know, my vision loss and starting to be comfortable and figure out who I was again, got some training, started doing kind of all the things I would do in life before I lost my vision. Skating was one of those and then just started -- yeah, I started very slow trying escape wearing one day and then posting some videos on it. SUBTITLE:  Now, Mancina wants to create a space where visually impaired people can enjoy the sport. He is currently building the first fully adaptive skate park, which he says is set to open in 2023.  MANCINA:  I wanted to build like the first fully adaptive skate park kind of designed around visual impairments and stuff like that. It's just like the environment that has visual impairment as well as like WCMX, that's the wheelchair motocross stuff in mind. Ledges are really long and quarter pipes are really wide, so I'm just kind of more time to figure out where you are in the park, using a lot of like contrast is important for those who have a little bit of residual vision between the ramps and the ground, so it's easier to pick up and see. SUBTITLE:  He also wants to challenge misconceptions around blindness and how that affects opportunities for kids. MANCINA:  They should have access to everything just like every other child. So skateboarding is just one of those things. You know, it's not for everybody, but there are going to be those kids who want to skate, so yeah, equal opportunities for everybody. I enjoy skating so I'm going to do it. So I encourage people to kind of more think that way. You know, don't let other people dictate your life and decide what -- what you can and can't do. You know, it's all up to you, and it's kind of the biggest thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's "10 out of 10", a dog on cute creation that deserves a round of applause. David Jensen was tired of riding his bike alone so he got creative so that he could take his pups Salt and Pepper along for the ride. He got a long John a type of cargo bike then custom built a box for the dogs, but he also made them some awesome goggles or shall we say goggles so the wind isn't rough on their eyes.
